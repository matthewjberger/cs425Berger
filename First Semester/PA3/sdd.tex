\chapter{Overview}

	\section{Abstract}
Navatar is an indoor navigation system for visually impaired students. Unlike existing systems that rely on expensive equipment, Navatar only requires an Android smartphone. The phone’s GPS and accelerometer are used to approximate a user's location and movements and the phone’s speaker is used to provide auditory directions to rooms within a building. Buildings on University campuses often have the GIS maps and the design required for Navatar’s accelerometer based localization, which is why students are the intended audience for the project. With the application’s open source status and modular design, crowdsourcing efforts can be used to integrate maps for buildings on any campus. The application is still under development and Team 6 is working on a variety of new features alongside other open source contributors.

	\section{Introduction}
The main goals and objectives of this project are to help blind people navigate indoor environments using a mobile phone and open source software which allows for a very low overall cost. Most people already have a cell phone, and mobile phones have a wide array of sensors available for environmental information. Accessibility is a major issue for many students with disabilities, and the technology necessary to ease the burden of some tasks that can be needlessly complicated is available and waiting to be utilized. Currently, there is no free and open source software capable of gathering environmental information and assisting students with indoor navigation for an entire college campus.
    The high level requirements of this software include being simple to use, low-cost, scalable, maintainable, and efficient in its assistance to blind users. The intended audience of this project, as stated, is blind students and partially blind students. Existing and familiar environments will be conquered through the use of landmarks and bookmarks. A bookmark in this case would be a landmark that the user sets manually, that gets stored specifically for that user. The reason behind this is that many partially-sighted and blind users remember details that sighted people may not utilize or need, such as a metal strip on the floor, that help them remember where they are in an indoor setting relative to where they want to go.
    The project itself currently exists as a repository on GitHub that contains a mobile android app. The members Team 6 all currently have a fork and are working on learning the code base to facilitate the development of new features. The future of this software depends greatly on what we are capable of achieving in the time-frame provided, but we plan on implementing many features. The first planned enhancement is the implementation of geofencing to determine what building the user is in. Possible future enhancements include the ability for users to declare and input their own landmarks, third party device integration to improve usability and accuracy (i.e. smart watches, Bluetooth earpieces), using additional environment information such as wifi SSIDs, making the app more scalable, improving map conversion and creation, user profile learning, stride detection, and gesture-based UI/UX improvements.

\section{User Interface Design}
These screenshots demonstrate intended user interface design of the software. The software is meant for blind users however, so the UI demonstrated here would be navigated with audio cues or swiping gestures in the final application.

 \textbf{Summary:}
Investigates various solutions to the problem of indoor navigation for the visually impaired. Describes the issues that make indoor localization systems difficult to implement, and weighs the pros and cons of solutions that are currently available. These solutions include using RFID tags, cameras, or range finders to provide locational information. These solutions are quite expensive due to high installation and equipment costs. The article proposes the use of common smartphone sensors in combination with user interaction and user provided landmarks to provide navigational information to the user. Provides technical specifications for estimating a user’s location.
